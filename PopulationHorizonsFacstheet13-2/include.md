**Cross-country comparison of proportions of people living in different types of households**

The prevalence of different household living arrangements varies across countries and across different population groups.

The two types of classifications of households used here are:

1. UN Typology -- the household composition based on family nuclei:

* *One person household* -- A single person living alone. 
* *Nuclear household* -- a couple with or without children, or a single parent.
* *Extended household* -- members beyond the family nucleus are related
by blood or marriage.
* *Composite household* -- other persons are present who are not related to the head. 


2. Intergenerational structure of the household:

* *One person household* -- A single person living alone. 
* *One generation household*--at least one more person of the same age group as the head. Usually a spouse, but can also be sibling etc.
* *Two generation household*--at least one more person one generation younger/older than the head. Usually child(ren), can also be parent etc. 
* *Three or more generation household*--at least two more persons of different generations than the head (but without skipping generations).
* *Skipped generation household*--at least one generation missing. Usually head with grandchildren but without children.

The proportions displayed are of individuals living in each type of household (not proportions of households of each type) and show important differences between genders, as well broader patterns that can be observed regionally and globally.

The living arrangements of each age group can also be contrasted to the average of the population as a whole, which
is displayed as the *background* of each bar chart.

The width of the two bars corresponds to the relative numbers of men and women in the relevant age groups, with the percentage given underneath. All proportions are based on weighted counts from IPUMS data.
