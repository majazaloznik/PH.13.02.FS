Nuclear family is defined as couple w/wo unmarried children. so need to 
get unmarried? but if the child's partner lives with them that' already extended, so don't need to worry. So techincally theseare couple (single parent) living with unmarried children (or rather children without their partners).i.e. if the child is married but their spouse doesn't live in the household, then it counts as a nuclear family. the child could be widowed, married living apart etc. but not havechildren (grandchildren)
